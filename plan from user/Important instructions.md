- before writing any code ensure the following tasks are complete
	- complete documentation of what is to be created
	- based on the technology stack make sure you have documented where to find the latest docs for each technology via Context7
	- create a .cursor/rules folder and add to it appropriate .mdc files that clearly detail how the LLM is to work with each technology
		- as a starting point, find the relevant set of rules from <https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use>
	- if you have questions ask the user and iterate as needed until everything is clarified
	- git repo created, configured, and pushed to remote
	- project plan with granular tasks that are small enough to be completed within a single context window. this will reduce the potential for error during development
- create instructions for how the LLM is to use the task list and general instructions that the LLM will follow when starting each step. e.g.:
	- find next step in the task list
	- look up relevant documentation for the current task, preferably via Context 7
	- understand which components and functions you can use that you already have before creating anything new
	- write code to copmlete the task
	- check your work in a browser and ensure the following:
		- it functions as expected and required by the task
		- there are no errors in the console
		- there are no build errors
	- only once the feature has passed your test may you consider that task complete
		- mark the task in the list as completed
- stage all changes, write a reasonable commit message, and push to remote
- rebuild the code and restart the development server so the user can see the latest version and provide feedback
